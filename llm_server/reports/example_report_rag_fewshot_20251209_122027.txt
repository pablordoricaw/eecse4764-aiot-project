LLM DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS
======================================================================

**Diagnosis for ventilator-01 — Error: E-TEMP-HIGH (Internal temperature 70.6°C for 33.7 s)**

---

### Summary:
- **Device:** ventilator-01
- **Error:** Internal ventilator temperature above limit (70.6°C)
- **Duration:** 33.7 seconds
- **Room Temperature:** Stable at 18.8°C (within normal 18-28°C)
- **Room Humidity:** Stable at 30.5% (within normal 30-70%)
- **Device Normal Internal Temp Range:** ~45°C
- **Overheating Threshold:** >70°C

---

### Cross-Referencing Device and Room Data:

- Room conditions are stable and well within recommended environmental specs.
- The internal ventilator temperature (70.6°C) exceeded the overheating threshold significantly.
- Room temperature is low and stable, ruling out ambient heat as a cause.
- Humidity is low but within acceptable range; unlikely to cause overheating.

---

### Similar Historical Cases Reference:

- None of the historical cases show overheating at this level; those were communication failures or temperature regulation failures mostly linked to cooling malfunctions or cable issues.
- This case indicates an internal thermal issue rather than environmental or communication errors.

---

### Probable Root Cause:

**Overheating due to internal component malfunction (e.g., cooling system failure, blocked airflow, fan failure, or heat dissipation issue).**

- Since ambient conditions are normal, the problem is likely mechanical or electronic within the ventilator subsystem responsible for temperature control.
- Possible causes:
  - Cooling fan failure or obstruction.
  - Heat sink detachment or malfunction.
  - Internal sensor malfunction causing false high temp reading (less likely given duration and severity).
  - Excessive power draw or hardware fault causing overheating.

---

### Severity and FDA Classification:

- **Severity:** Critical (temperature well above safe operational limits)
- **FDA Code:** Thermal Hazard (likely TMF - Temperature Monitoring Failure category)

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Immediately stop or pause ventilator use** to prevent patient risk and device damage.
2. **Inspect cooling components:**
   - Verify operation of internal cooling fans.
   - Check for blockages or dust buildup in ventilation pathways.
3. **Measure internal temperatures manually if possible** to confirm sensor accuracy.
4. **Check for firmware/software faults** related to temperature control loops.
5. **Run diagnostic self-tests** if supported by device.
6. **Contact service technician** for hardware inspection and possible repair/replacement.
7. **Document all findings and maintain logs** for FDA reporting if required.

---

### Confidence Level: High (90%)
Based on stable normal ambient conditions and persistent high internal temperature.

If you provide further device logs or maintenance history, I can refine this diagnosis.
