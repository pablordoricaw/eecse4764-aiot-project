╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝  

**Device:** ventilator-01  
**Error:** E-TEMP-HIGH — Internal ventilator temperature above limit (77.9 °C for 33.7 s)  
**Subsystem:** SENSORS  
**Room Conditions:** 24.6°C, 18.7% RH (Stable)  
**Device Internal Temp Normal:** ~45°C  
**Overheat Threshold:** >70°C (Confirmed exceeded)  
**Room Temperature/Humidity Recommended:** 18-28°C, 30-70% RH  

---

### Root Cause Analysis:

- The internal ventilator temperature (77.9°C) significantly exceeds the normal operating range (~45°C) and the overheating threshold (>70°C).  
- Room temperature is within normal limits (24.6°C), but humidity is very low (18.7%), below the recommended minimum of 30%.  
- Low ambient humidity is unlikely to cause internal overheating directly, but may contribute to static discharge or component stress over time.  
- The internal sensor confirms stable room temperature and humidity, ruling out external environmental heat as immediate cause.  

---

### Most Probable Root Cause:  
**Ventilator internal cooling system malfunction or airflow obstruction leading to heat buildup.**  

- The device’s internal cooling or ventilation subsystem may have failed or be blocked.  
- Internal fans, heat sinks, or cooling circuits might be damaged or clogged with dust/debris.  
- Prolonged operation without adequate internal heat dissipation leads to sustained overheating (33.7 seconds above threshold).  

---

### Supporting Similar Historical Cases:  
- No direct matching case for overheating at this temperature with low humidity, but cooling malfunction is a common cause of internal overheating.  
- Room temp stable and within spec excludes ambient heat source.  
- Similar cases show hardware or component failures causing temperature regulation errors.  

---

### Severity: **Critical** (Potential for device damage or patient risk)  

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting & Actions:  

1. **Immediately stop ventilator operation if possible and switch to backup device.**  
2. Inspect and test internal cooling components (fans, vents, heat exchangers). Clean or replace if obstructed or faulty.  
3. Check for firmware or sensor errors that might cause false temperature readings (unlikely given duration and severity).  
4. Verify power supply stability—overheating can be caused by power surges or component stress.  
5. Confirm no external heat sources near device or blocked airflow around the ventilator.  
6. Record and monitor device temperature after maintenance to confirm resolution.  
7. Report to biomedical engineering and consider FDA mandatory reporting if device failure confirmed.  

---

### Summary:  
Despite normal ambient temperature, the ventilator shows sustained internal overheating indicative of cooling failure or airflow obstruction. This is a critical safety issue requiring urgent maintenance intervention to avoid device failure or patient harm.
