LLM DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS
======================================================================

## FDA ERROR CLASSIFICATION
- **FDA Error Code:** Thermal Management Failure (TMF-004)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Device Status:** Malfunctioning

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- **Primary Cause:** Overheating due to inadequate cooling or ventilation.
- **Contributing Factors:** Extended duty cycle, possible blockage of cooling vents.
- **Evidence from logs:** The logs show consistent “System nominal” messages leading up to the error, suggesting stable operation before a sudden temperature spike. Following the error, the logs still indicate nominal status, which may imply a lag in sensor reading or intermittent fault.
- **Evidence from temperature:** The temperature readings indicate a rising trend from 58.8°C to 93.8°C over 37 samples, with an average of 61.3°C which is significantly high for operational parameters.
- **Confidence:** 85%

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Power down the device to prevent further escalation.
2. **DIAGNOSTIC:** Inspect cooling fans and ventilation ports for blockages or degradation.
3. **CORRECTIVE:** Replace any faulty cooling components identified during inspection.
4. **PREVENTIVE:** Schedule regular maintenance checks and ensure adequate airflow around the device.

## SAFETY ASSESSMENT
- **Patient Risk:** High
- **Continue Use:** No
- **Escalate:** Immediate action required if patient support is dependent on the ventilator. Consider alternative arrangements for patient care.
