║                            DIAGNOSIS                              ║  
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝  

**Device:** ventilator-01  
**Error:** E-TEMP-HIGH — Internal ventilator temperature at 78.9°C for 30 seconds (breath 99)  
**Subsystem:** SENSORS  
**Room Conditions:** Stable, 24.8°C temperature, 18.9% humidity  

---

### Analysis:

- **Internal Temperature:** 78.9°C exceeds the ventilator's overheating threshold (>70°C), indicating critical overheating.  
- **Room Temperature:** 24.8°C, well within the acceptable range (18-28°C).  
- **Room Humidity:** 18.9%, below recommended (30-70%), but low humidity alone typically does not cause internal overheating.  
- **Trend:** Room conditions are stable, so ambient environment is unlikely the direct cause of overheating.  

---

### Cross-Reference with Historical Cases:

- No prior cases exactly match internal temperature >70°C with stable room temp and low humidity for ventilators.  
- Historical cases mostly involved communication failures or low operating temperature due to cold ambient environment, not overheating.  

---

### Likely Root Cause:

1. **Internal Cooling Failure:** The ventilator’s internal cooling system (fans, heat exchangers) may be malfunctioning or blocked, causing heat buildup despite normal room temperature.  
2. **Sensor Fault or Drift:** The internal temperature sensor might be faulty or stuck reporting high temperature; however, sustained high temp reading for 30 seconds suggests true overheating.  
3. **Mechanical or Electrical Issue:** Possible excessive internal load, fan motor failure, or power supply problem causing overheating.  
4. **Low Humidity Contribution:** While low humidity itself is not a direct cause, it may exacerbate static or electrical issues that affect cooling components.  

---

### Severity: **CRITICAL**  
Overheating at 78.9°C risks device failure and patient safety. Immediate intervention needed.

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting & Actions:

- **Immediate:**  
  - Remove ventilator from patient use until fully inspected.  
  - Power cycle device if safe, monitor if error persists.  

- **Inspection:**  
  - Check and clean internal cooling fans and vents for blockage or dust buildup.  
  - Verify fan operation and airflow inside the ventilator.  
  - Inspect temperature sensor wiring and connectors for damage or loose contacts.  
  - Perform hardware diagnostics if available.  

- **Environmental:**  
  - Though room temp is normal, increase humidity to recommended levels (30-70%) if possible to reduce static risks.  
  - Ensure proper ventilation around the device.  

- **Reporting:**  
  - Report the incident to biomedical engineering and manufacturer for further analysis and possible hardware repair or replacement.  
  - Log this event per FDA regulatory compliance for temperature-related device failures (code: Overheating - VNTL-HT01).  

---

### Summary:

The ventilator is critically overheating internally despite stable and normal room temperature conditions. The root cause is most likely an internal cooling system failure or sensor malfunction rather than ambient environmental factors. Immediate device removal from service and thorough inspection are essential to prevent patient risk and device damage.
