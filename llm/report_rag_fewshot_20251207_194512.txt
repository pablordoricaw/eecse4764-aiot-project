### Device vs. Room Conditions Analysis

| Parameter             | Device Internal Temp | Room Temp | Room Humidity | Expected Range                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------|-----------|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Temperature           | 74.5°C (high)       | 24.8°C    | 18.9%         | Ventilator normal: ~45°C       |
|                       |                     |           |               | Overheating threshold: >70°C  |
| Room Temperature      | —                   | 24.8°C    | 18.9%         | 18-28°C                       |
| Room Humidity         | —                   | —         | 18.9%         | 30-70%                       |

- Room temperature is **within normal operating range**.
- Room humidity is **below minimum recommended (18.9% vs 30%)**, which is abnormally dry.

---

### Interpretation:

- The ventilator’s **internal temperature is critically high** (74.5°C), indicating overheating.
- The **room temperature is normal and stable**, so ambient heat is unlikely the primary cause.
- **Low humidity (18.9%)** may contribute to static discharge or inadequate cooling efficiency but is not a direct cause of overheating.
- No fluctuations or abnormalities detected in room temperature/humidity trends.
- Control loops and sensors report stable readings aside from the high internal temp error.

---

### Root Cause Hypothesis:

- **Likely cause:** Internal cooling system failure or airflow obstruction inside the ventilator subsystem.  
- **Supporting factors:**  
  - Internal sensor confirms sustained overheating despite normal ambient conditions.  
  - Low ambient humidity might exacerbate electronic component stress but is not the main factor.  
- **Less likely:** Environmental factors (room temperature/humidity) causing this error, as conditions are within acceptable limits except humidity.

---

### Severity:

- **Critical:** Overheating >70°C risks device damage and patient safety. Immediate action required.

---

### FDA Classification:

- **FDA Code:** Temperature Regulation Failure (TMF-251) — Ventilator-specific overheating  
- Severity: Critical  
- Confidence Level: 90% based on data and historical patterns

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Immediately take ventilator offline** for safety to prevent hardware damage or patient harm.
2. Inspect internal cooling components: fans, heat sinks, airflow vents for blockage or failure.
3. Verify internal temperature sensor calibration and function.
4. Check for firmware or software control loop errors related to temperature management.
5. Improve room humidity to within 30-50% if possible to reduce static risk (although not primary cause).
6. If hardware failure suspected, arrange for device servicing/replacement per FDA-regulated maintenance protocol.

---

### Summary:

- Internal ventilator temperature is critically elevated at 74.5°C despite normal room temperature and low humidity.
- Root cause is almost certainly an internal cooling or airflow failure, not ambient conditions.
- Immediate device shutdown and technical service required to prevent failure or patient risk.
