╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝  

**Device:** ventilator-01  
**Error:** E-TEMP-HIGH — Internal ventilator temperature above limit (77.9 °C for 33.7 s)  
**Subsystem:** SENSORS  
**Error Severity:** Critical (Internal temp > 70°C threshold for ventilators)  

---

### Room Environment Summary  
- Temperature: 24.8°C (stable) — Within recommended room temp range (18-28°C)  
- Humidity: 18.9% (stable) — Below recommended humidity range (30-70%)  

---

### Analysis  

1. **Device Internal Temperature:**  
   - The ventilator’s internal temperature is critically high at 77.9°C, well above the acceptable maximum (~45°C normal, >70°C overheating).  
   - Prolonged overheating (33.7 s) poses serious risks of hardware damage or failure.  

2. **Room Conditions:**  
   - Ambient temperature is within acceptable limits for device operation.  
   - Ambient humidity is low (18.9%), below the recommended 30-70% range. This low humidity can contribute to electrostatic discharge risk and may affect cooling efficiency or sensor performance.  

3. **Cross-Reference With Historical Cases:**  
   - No direct match in historical cases for overheating at normal room temperature but low humidity is a notable environmental factor.  
   - Historical cases with temperature sensor errors mostly point to cooling system failures or communication issues, but none with internal temps as high as this.  

4. **Probable Root Cause:**  
   - **Cooling system malfunction or failure** inside the ventilator causing internal temperature to rise despite stable and acceptable room temperature.  
   - Low ambient humidity may exacerbate internal thermal regulation or sensor readings but is likely a secondary contributor.

### Recommended Troubleshooting Steps  

| Step | Action                                                                                 |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Immediately power down ventilator to prevent hardware damage or patient risk.          |
| 2     | Inspect and test ventilator’s internal cooling system (fans, heat sinks, thermal sensors). |
| 3     | Check for airflow obstructions within device casing or vents.                          |
| 4     | Verify firmware/software controlling temperature regulation is up to date.            |
| 5     | Confirm power supply stability and voltage levels (overvoltage can cause overheating). |
| 6     | Increase room humidity towards recommended 30-70% range to optimize device environment.|
| 7     | If problem persists, contact device manufacturer for service or replacement.           |

### FDA Regulatory Notes  

- **FDA Code:** Thermal Management Failure (TMF-xxx, similar to TMF-250 in historical cases)  
- **Severity:** Critical — Immediate intervention required to prevent patient harm  
- **Documentation:** Record all events, environmental conditions, and corrective actions for compliance.  

---

### Summary  

The ventilator is experiencing a critical internal overheating event despite stable and acceptable ambient temperature, with low humidity as a possible contributing factor. The root cause is most likely a malfunction in the device’s cooling system or internal thermal regulation. Immediate shutdown and technical inspection are mandatory to ensure patient safety and device integrity.
