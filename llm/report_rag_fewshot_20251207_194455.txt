### Diagnosis Report for Device ID: ventilator-01  
**Error Code:** E-TEMP-HIGH  
**Error Message:** Internal ventilator temperature above limit for 30.0 s on breath 39 (70.6 °C)  
**Error Time:** 2025-12-07T01:41:24.759531+00:00  
**Subsystem:** SENSORS  

---

### Summary of Findings:

- **Internal device temperature:** 70.6 °C (exceeds ventilator overheating threshold >70°C)  
- **Room temperature:** 24.8 °C (within normal ambient range 18-28°C)  
- **Room humidity:** 18.9% (below recommended 30-70%)  
- **Temperature trend:** Stable  
- **Humidity trend:** Stable  

---

### Interpretation:

1. **Internal Overheating:**  
   The device’s internal temperature is critically high (70.6°C), sustained for 30 seconds, which indicates overheating. This is above the ventilator’s normal internal operating temperature (~45°C) and meets the overheating threshold.

2. **Room Conditions:**  
   - Ambient temperature (24.8°C) is within acceptable limits, so the overheating is unlikely due to cold or hot room conditions.  
   - Ambient humidity (18.9%) is significantly below the recommended range (30-70%). Low humidity can contribute to electrostatic discharge or reduced cooling efficiency in some electronic systems, potentially exacerbating heat dissipation issues.

3. **Device Logs:**  
   - Sensors report normal room conditions but warn about sustained internal temperature elevation.  
   - Control loop status indicates system stability despite the high temperature, suggesting the device’s internal control is attempting to manage the anomaly.

---

### Root Cause Hypothesis:

**Primary cause:** Internal overheating of the ventilator subsystem, likely due to malfunction in internal cooling components (e.g., fan failure, heat sink degradation, or blocked air vents).  
**Contributing factors:**  
- The low ambient humidity (18.9%) might reduce heat dissipation efficiency or contribute to increased static discharge risk affecting sensor readings or cooling elements.  
- Stable room temperature eliminates ambient thermal extremes as a cause.

---

### Severity: **CRITICAL**  
The device is at risk of failure or damage due to overheating, which can compromise patient safety.

---

### FDA Classification & Code:  
- **FDA Code:** Thermal Regulation Failure (TMF-251, ventilator-specific)  
- **Severity:** Critical

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting and Actions:

1. **Immediate Actions:**  
   - Remove the ventilator from clinical use until resolved to ensure patient safety.  
   - Inspect internal cooling system components: fans, vents, heat sinks for blockages, dust, or mechanical failure.  
   - Verify sensor calibration and integrity for temperature sensors inside the ventilator.

2. **Environmental Controls:**  
   - Increase ambient humidity towards the 30-50% range to improve device cooling efficiency.  
   - Confirm adequate airflow around the ventilator (no obstructions).

3. **Device Restart and Monitoring:**  
   - After inspection and corrective actions, power cycle the device and monitor internal temperature closely for recurrence.  
   - Log and report any repeated overheating events.

4. **Escalation:**  
   - If overheating persists despite environmental normalization and hardware inspection, escalate to manufacturer technical support for hardware diagnostics or replacement.

---

### Summary:

The ventilator-01 is experiencing **critical internal overheating** independent of room temperature, likely due to internal cooling failure exacerbated by unusually low ambient humidity. Immediate device inspection and environmental adjustment are required before safe clinical use can resume.
