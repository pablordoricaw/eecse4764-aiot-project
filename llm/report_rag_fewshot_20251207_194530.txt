╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝  

**Device:** ventilator-01  
**Error:** E-TEMP-HIGH (Internal ventilator temperature above limit)  
**Internal Temp:** 78.8 °C (duration: 30s)  
**Room Temp:** 24.8 °C (stable)  
**Room Humidity:** 18.9% (stable, low)  

---

### Interpretation:

- The internal ventilator temperature (78.8 °C) is significantly **above** the normal operating range (~45 °C) and exceeds the overheating threshold (>70 °C) for ventilators.  
- Room temperature (24.8 °C) is **within** the acceptable range (18-28 °C).  
- Room humidity (18.9%) is **below** the recommended minimum (30-70%), indicating dry ambient conditions.  

---

### Similar Historical Case Reference:

- **No direct match** for ventilator overheating at this low humidity, but extrapolating from similar temperature sensor errors:  
  - Overheating is typically linked to device internal cooling failure, component malfunction, or airflow obstruction.  
  - Low humidity can exacerbate thermal stress by drying internal components or affecting cooling efficiency, but is not a primary cause.  
  - Room temperature is stable and normal, so ambient cold or heat is unlikely the main factor.

---

### Root Cause Hypothesis:

- **Primary Cause:** Internal cooling system malfunction or blockage in ventilator-01 causing heat buildup.  
- **Contributing Factor:** Low ambient humidity (18.9%) may reduce cooling efficiency or affect sensor operation but is not the main driver.  
- No evidence of ambient temp extremes or communication failures.  

---

### Severity:

- **CRITICAL:** Sustained internal temperature >70 °C can damage device electronics and compromise patient safety. Immediate attention required.

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting & Actions:

1. **Immediate:**  
   - Power down ventilator-01 safely to prevent damage.  
   - Inspect and clean internal cooling pathways (fans, vents).  
   - Verify internal temperature sensors for faults or drift.  
   - Check for any obstructions or dust build-up affecting heat dissipation.  

2. **Environmental:**  
   - Increase room humidity towards recommended 30-70% to improve device environment.  
   - Confirm no nearby heat sources or airflow disruptions affecting device cooling.  

3. **Follow-up:**  
   - After servicing, monitor internal temperature closely during operation.  
   - Consider device calibration or service if overheating persists.  
   - Report to FDA if device failure is confirmed as per regulatory guidelines (code likely related to Temperature Regulation Failure).  

---

### Summary:

The ventilator is experiencing a **critical internal overheating condition** unrelated to ambient temperature (which is stable and normal). The low humidity is suboptimal but not the primary cause. The root cause is likely a **cooling system failure or internal airflow obstruction** requiring immediate corrective maintenance to prevent device damage and ensure patient safety.
