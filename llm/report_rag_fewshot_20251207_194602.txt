### Diagnosis for Device ID: ventilator-01  
**Error Code:** E-TEMP-HIGH  
**Error Message:** Internal ventilator temperature above limit for 30.0 s on breath 90 (76.5 °C)  
**Subsystem:** SENSORS  
**Room Conditions:** Stable 24.8°C / 18.9% RH  

---

### Analysis Summary:

- **Internal Device Temperature:** 76.5°C (exceeds ventilator overheating threshold >70°C)  
- **Room Temperature:** 24.8°C (within recommended 18-28°C)  
- **Room Humidity:** 18.9% (below recommended 30-70%)  
- **Temperature Trend:** Stable ambient temperature, no fluctuation  
- **Humidity Trend:** Stable but low humidity environment  

---

### Root Cause Hypothesis:

1. **Overheating Inside Ventilator (Critical):**  
   The ventilator is experiencing critical internal overheating (76.5°C), which is well above the normal internal operating temperature (~45°C) and the overheating threshold (>70°C). This sustained high internal temperature (30 seconds) poses a risk to device function and patient safety.

2. **Environmental Factors Contribution:**  
   - Ambient temperature is within acceptable range, so external heat is unlikely the direct cause.  
   - Ambient humidity is significantly below the recommended minimum (18.9% vs. 30-70%), which may contribute to electrostatic discharge or reduced heat dissipation efficiency inside the device.  
   
3. **Potential Internal Causes:**  
   - **Cooling system malfunction:** Fans, heat sinks or internal airflow may be impaired or blocked.  
   - **Sensor or control loop malfunction:** The temperature sensor or control algorithm may be faulty, causing insufficient cooling response.  
   - **Power subsystem or motor overheating:** Mechanical components inside the ventilator may be generating excess heat due to wear or failure.  

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Immediate Actions:**  
   - Power down the ventilator safely and inspect for physical blockages or dust accumulation on cooling fans or vents.  
   - Check that the internal cooling system (fans, heat sinks) is operational and unobstructed.  
   - Verify firmware/software control loops for temperature regulation are responsive.

2. **Electrical and Sensor Checks:**  
   - Test temperature sensors for faults or calibration drift.  
   - Inspect power supply and internal motors for overheating or abnormal current draw.

3. **Environmental Adjustments:**  
   - Increase room humidity to the recommended range (30-70%) if possible, to improve device cooling efficiency and reduce electrostatic risks.  
   - Confirm room ventilation and airflow are adequate.

4. **Refer to Manufacturer and FDA Codes:**  
   - This error aligns with **Temperature Regulation Failure (TMF-250)**  
   - Severity: Critical — immediate intervention required to prevent device damage or patient risk.

### Summary:

| Aspect                  | Value              | Expected Range          | Notes                          |
|-------------------------|--------------------|------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Internal Device Temp     | 76.5°C             | ~45°C normal, >70°C critical | Overheating detected            |
| Room Temperature        | 24.8°C             | 18-28°C                | Within range                   |
| Room Humidity           | 18.9%              | 30-70%                 | Below recommended minimum      |
| Severity                | Critical           |                        | Action required immediately    |

---

**Final Diagnosis:**  
Ventilator-01 is experiencing a critical internal overheating event likely caused by an internal cooling malfunction or sensor/control failure, exacerbated by low ambient humidity. Immediate mechanical inspection, cooling system repair, and room humidity correction are necessary to resolve the issue and avoid device failure.
