LLM DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS
======================================================================

## FDA ERROR CLASSIFICATION
- **FDA Error Code:** Thermal Management Failure (TMF-003)
- **Severity:** Critical
- **Device Status:** High temperature threshold exceeded

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- **Primary Cause:** Potential malfunction of the cooling system, leading to elevated temperatures.
- **Contributing Factors:** 
  - Environmental conditions 
  - Possible component degradation
- **Evidence from logs:** 
  - Logs indicate the system remained nominal prior to the error: `[INFO] System nominal. Cycle: 619, 324, 765, 296, 608`
  - The critical error was flagged immediately after a series of nominal cycles, showing no warning signs before the malfunction.
- **Evidence from temperature:** 
  - Temperature readings remained stable at 25.9°C, but the error message indicates a threshold exceeded while slightly elevated ambient temperatures may be planned for normal operational ranges.
- **Confidence:** 85%

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
1. **IMMEDIATE:** Power down the ventilator to prevent further overheating.
2. **DIAGNOSTIC:** Inspect the cooling system, including the fan and ventilation ports, for any obstructions or failures.
3. **CORRECTIVE:** Replace any faulty components within the thermal management system.
4. **PREVENTIVE:** Implement regular checks and maintenance of the cooling system to ensure functionality and reliability.

## SAFETY ASSESSMENT
- **Patient Risk:** High (due to overheating and potential device failure)
- **Continue Use:** No (immediate shutdown is required to ensure safety)
- **Escalate:** Yes, if critical thresholds are repeatedly exceeded or if multiple failures occur after troubleshooting actions.
