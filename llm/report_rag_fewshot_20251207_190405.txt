╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝  

**Device:** ventilator-01  
**Error:** E-TEMP-HIGH (Internal temperature 78.4°C for 30 seconds)  
**Subsystem:** SENSORS  
**Room Temperature:** 25.7°C (stable)  
**Room Humidity:** 19.0% (stable)  

---

### Analysis Summary:

- The ventilator's internal temperature (78.4°C) **exceeds the overheating threshold (>70°C)** for this device type, indicating a critical thermal event.
- Room temperature (25.7°C) is within the **normal operating range for the device** (18-28°C).
- Room humidity (19.0%) is **below the recommended 30-70% range**, which can contribute to electrostatic discharge or sensor malfunction, but unlikely to cause direct overheating.
- Logs show sensors reading normal ambient conditions, yet the internal device temperature remains critically high, suggesting an internal hardware or cooling failure rather than an environmental cause.

---

### Root Cause Hypothesis:

- **Primary:** Internal cooling system malfunction or sensor failure causing inaccurate temperature regulation inside the ventilator.
- **Secondary contributing factor:** Low ambient humidity (19%) may exacerbate component stress or sensor drift, but is not the main driver of overheating.
- No evidence of external environmental heat stress or rapid ambient temperature fluctuations.

---

### Similar Historical Case Reference:

- No direct match in cases — previous overheating cases involved low ambient temperature or cooling failure in cold environments.
- This case is unique due to stable ambient temperature but critically high internal temp.

---

### Severity & Regulatory Classification:

- **Severity:** Critical  
- **FDA Code:** Thermal Safety Hazard (THS-401) - Device overheating potentially leading to patient harm or device failure.

---

### Recommended Troubleshooting and Actions:

1. **Immediate:**  
   - Power down the ventilator to prevent damage or patient risk.  
   - Verify internal cooling system (fans, heat sinks, thermal interface materials) are functional.

2. **Diagnostics:**  
   - Run built-in self-tests focusing on thermal sensors and cooling subsystem.  
   - Inspect for blocked air vents, dust buildup, or mechanical failures in cooling components.

3. **Environmental:**  
   - Increase room humidity to the recommended range (30–70%) to reduce electrostatic risks and improve sensor reliability.  
   - Confirm room ventilation and airflow are adequate.

4. **Long-term:**  
   - Replace or repair thermal sensor module if found faulty.  
   - Review device maintenance logs for prior overheating warnings.  
   - Update device firmware if thermal control algorithms have updates.

---

### Confidence Level: 85%  
Based on critical internal temperature readings paired with stable and acceptable room temperature but low humidity, the root cause is very likely an internal hardware cooling failure rather than environmental factors.

---

**Summary:**  
The ventilator is overheating internally despite stable room temperature, pointing to a critical cooling system malfunction. Immediate shutdown and technical inspection are urgently required to prevent device failure or patient harm.
