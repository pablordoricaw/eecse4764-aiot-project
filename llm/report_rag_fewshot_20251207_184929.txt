ERROR SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Error Code: SENSOR_READ_OK
Message: Sensors within expected range for breath 14
Timestamp: 2025-12-07T01:39:51.007599+00:00
Subsystem: SENSORS

LLM DIAGNOSTIC ANALYSIS
======================================================================

## FDA ERROR CLASSIFICATION
- FDA Error Code: NOP-000 (Normal Operation)
- Severity: None
- Device Status: Operational

## ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS
- Primary Cause: No fault detected. The ventilator sensors report readings within expected ranges and stable conditions. Internal temperature is not explicitly reported but inferred to be normal given no overheating messages.
- Contributing Factors: None
- Evidence from device: Device messages indicate "Sensors within expected range for breath 14" and "Control loop stable" with stable temperature reading of 25.7°C.
- Evidence from room sensors: Room temperature is 25.7°C and humidity is 20.0%. Temperature is within recommended range (18-28°C), although humidity is slightly below the typical 30-70% range but not critical.
- Cross-reference analysis: Device reports no errors or abnormal temperatures; room conditions are within acceptable limits for operation. Stable sensor readings and control loops confirm normal function.
- Confidence: 99%

## TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS
1. IMMEDIATE: Continue normal operation, no immediate action required.
2. DIAGNOSTIC: Perform routine sensor calibration checks as per preventive maintenance schedule.
3. CORRECTIVE: None needed at this time.
4. PREVENTIVE: Maintain room temperature between 18-28°C and humidity ideally between 30-70%. Consider humidification if room humidity remains below 30% for extended periods.

## SAFETY ASSESSMENT
- Patient Risk: None
- Continue Use: Yes
- Escalate: Only if device status changes or abnormal temperature/humidity detected, or sensor readings become unstable.
